# electron_basic_chat
Basic chat developed in the third and fourth chapters of "Cross-platform Desktop Application Development: Electron, Node, NW.js, and React"

This app have some modifications from book code.

I have added new functionality to start chat as host or as client so you can use it to have a private lan chat with one client working as host and some remote clients.

## How to use it
Install dependencies
```
npm install 
```

Start app
```
npm start 
```

If you want to make a installer you can do it with 
```
npm run build && npm run dist
```
